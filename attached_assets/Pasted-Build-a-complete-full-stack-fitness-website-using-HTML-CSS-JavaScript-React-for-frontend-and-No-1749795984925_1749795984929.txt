Build a complete full-stack fitness website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React for frontend), and Node.js or Firebase (backend). The website should be visually modern, responsive, and mobile-friendly. Include the following **highly unique and impressive features** that can make this project stand out in interviews:

1. 💡 AI-Powered Personalized Diet Recommender:
   - User inputs: age, weight, fitness goal (weight loss, muscle gain), allergies.
   - AI recommends a dynamic weekly meal plan and calorie intake.
   - Uses OpenAI API for intelligent meal suggestions.

2. 📹 Interactive Workout Tutorials:
   - Embedded video tutorials (YouTube/Cloud links).
   - Categorized by beginner/intermediate/advanced.
   - User progress tracker (checklist style) for each category.

3. 🧠 Smart AI Chatbot:
   - Built using OpenAI API.
   - Can answer user questions about diet, fitness, mental health.
   - Should be integrated with a chatbot UI on the frontend.

4. 📈 Real-Time Progress Tracker:
   - Charts to track workout sessions, calories burnt, and mood logs.
   - Use Chart.js or Recharts to display user fitness analytics.

5. 📍 Smart Gym Locator:
   - Use Google Maps API to suggest nearest gyms based on user’s location.

6. 🎯 Weekly Goals + Reward Badges:
   - Users can set weekly fitness goals.
   - Reward badges (e.g., “Cardio King”) for achieving milestones.

7. 🖱️ Unique Animated Cursor Effects:
   - When hovered, cursor displays calories burnt or motivational quotes.
   - Add glowing/neon effect to align with the fitness theme.

8. 🌙 Dark Mode + Theme Toggle.

🔒 Login/Register using Firebase Authentication or JWT-based auth.

📦 Backend should handle:
- User data (authentication, progress, preferences)
- Diet plans
- Goal tracking
- AI interactions (via OpenAI or dummy data if no API key)

💾 Allow data persistence using Firebase Realtime Database or MongoDB.

💡 Use modular folder structure and clean, scalable code. All code should be written clearly with comments.

After completing, export the whole project (frontend + backend) so I can download and push it to GitHub. Do not include any watermark or branding.
